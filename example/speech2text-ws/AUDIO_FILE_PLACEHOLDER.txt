AUDIO FILE REQUIREMENTS FOR AOG SPEECH-TO-TEXT DEMO
==================================================

This directory needs an audio file to run the demo.

CRITICAL: AOG SERVER ONLY ACCEPTS PCM FORMAT
The AOG Speech-to-Text server ONLY processes PCM audio data.

SUPPORTED INPUT FORMATS (automatically converted to PCM):
- PCM (.pcm) - Raw PCM audio data (used directly, no conversion needed)
- WAV (.wav) - Uncompressed PCM WAV files (PCM data extracted from headers)
- MP3 (.mp3) - MP3 files (decoded to PCM before transmission)

IMPORTANT: AUTOMATIC PCM CONVERSION
The client performs format validation and automatic PCM conversion:
- WAV files: PCM data extracted after validating RIFF/WAVE structure
- MP3 files: Decoded to PCM using go-mp3 library after validation
- PCM files: Used directly without conversion
- ALL formats are sent to the server as PCM data only

PCM OUTPUT SPECIFICATIONS (after conversion):
- Sample Rate: 16kHz (optimal for AOG server)
- Channels: Mono (1 channel) recommended
- Bit Depth: 16-bit
- Encoding: Linear PCM, little-endian
- Language: Should match the configured language (default is Chinese "zh")

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Place your audio file in this directory
2. Name it "output.mp3" (or modify the audioFile constant in client.go)
3. Ensure the file contains clear speech content
4. Run the demo: go run client.go
5. The client will validate input format and convert to PCM automatically
6. Only PCM data is sent to the AOG server

FORMAT VALIDATION AND CONVERSION EXAMPLES:
✓ Valid WAV: RIFF header + WAVE identifier + PCM format → PCM extraction
✓ Valid MP3: ID3 tag or 0xFF frame sync pattern → PCM decoding
✓ Valid PCM: .pcm extension → Direct use
✗ Invalid: Compressed WAV, corrupted files, unsupported formats

UNSUPPORTED INPUT FORMATS:
- M4A, AAC, OGG, FLAC, WMA and other formats are NOT supported for PCM conversion
- Compressed WAV formats (MP3-in-WAV, etc.) cannot be converted to PCM
- If you have audio in other formats, convert to uncompressed PCM WAV or MP3 first

TROUBLESHOOTING:
- If validation fails, check the actual file format (not just extension)
- Use audio conversion tools to ensure proper input format for PCM conversion
- Test with a known-good audio file first
- Remember: Only PCM data reaches the AOG server regardless of input format

For testing, you can use any properly formatted audio file with speech content.
The client will handle the PCM conversion automatically.
